## ARCHIVE
Descending order of completion

### Graph ( preferably using Adjacency List -> Done with both: default being list )
- Implemented all in 2 classes with 1 interface and 1 factory function
- [X] Implement Directed Graph (No Weights)
- [X] Implement Weighted Graph (Un Directed)
- [X] Implement a simple undirected graph with no weights

---

### Deque (Double-Ended Queue)
- [X] Implement Deque with Array
  - Done with Array List due to reification
- [X] Implement Deque with Linked List
  - Done with a Singly Linked List Subclass

---

### Migrate existing Java implementations to Kotlin
- [X] Stack, Queue
- [X] Linked List
- [X] Heap, Priority Queue
- [X] Trie
- [X] Hash Table
- [X] Graph
- [X] Tree
